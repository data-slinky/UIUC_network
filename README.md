# UIUC Affiliations Network
A network diagram of the faculty, staff and administrators at the University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign. Links represent departmental affiliation of the employee. Note, the 
visualization is only for engineering. The entire dataset is uploaded in case you want to 
play with it. A thorough discussion is given 
[here](http://data-slinky.com/project/2_UIUC_affiliation_network/).

## Data
The data is from the [2015-2016 Gray Book](http://www.bot.uillinois.edu/grey-book) which contains public information of people associated with the university. We provide the processed data as well as the code to scrape.
